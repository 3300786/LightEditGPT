{"prompt": "Q: where does the distributor get its power from\nA:", "target": "Distributor A distributor consists of a rotating arm or rotor inside the distributor cap, on top of the distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded carbon brush on the underside of the distributor cap. The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.[2]"}
{"prompt": "Q: how do cow produce milk all the time\nA:", "target": "Dairy cattle To maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \"dairy bull\" or a \"beef bull.\" Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age.[10] A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months.[11] Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf.[12]"}

In October 1943 the British Government decided to replace Lord Linlithgow with Lord Wavell as the Viceroy of India. Before assuming the viceroyalty, Lord Wavell had been head of the Indian army and thus had an understanding of the Indian situation. On becoming Viceroy, Wavellâ€™s most important task was to present a formula for the future government of India which would be acceptable to both Congress and the Muslim League."}

{"prompt": "Q: how many hours is considered a full-time job\nA:", "target": "Full-time Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer. Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sickleave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 35 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits."}

{"prompt": "Q: who acted as brian o'conner in furious 7\nA:", "target": "List of The Fast and the Furious characters Brian was portrayed by actor Paul Walker. Due to Walker's death in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013â€”with Furious 7 being incomplete, filming was put on hold to allow the cast and crew of the film to grieve.[7] The writers took this time to determine how to handle the fate of O'Conner in the film and decided that Walker's character will be retired from the franchise rather than killed. The film used some voice clips and cut scenes from previous installments, his look-alike brothers Caleb and Cody plus his CGI-generated face to complete filming. The film ends with a tribute to Walker including highlights of Walker's time in the Fast and Furious franchise and Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel giving an in-character voice over of how he will always be his brother, before the words \"For Paul\" are displayed on screen.

{"prompt": "Q: what was the highest oil price per barrel\nA:", "target": "Price of oil From 1999 til mid 2008, the price of oil rose significantly. It was explained by the rising oil demand in countries like China and India.[7] In the middle of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the price of oil underwent a significant decrease after the record peak of US$147.27 it reached on July 11, 2008. On December 23, 2008, WTI crude oil spot price fell to US$30.28 a barrel, the lowest since the financial crisis of 2007–2010 began. The price sharply rebounded after the crisis and rose to US$82 a barrel in 2009.[8] In July 2008 oil reached a record peak of US$147.27 but by February 2009 it sank beneath $40 a barrel.[9] On 31 January 2011, the Brent price hit $100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008, on concerns about the political unrest in Egypt.[10] For about three and half years the price largely remained in the $90–$120 range. In the middle of 2014, price started declining due to a significant increase in oil production in USA, and declining demand in the emerging countries.[11] The oil glut—caused by multiple factors—spurred a sharp downward spiral in the price of oil that continued through February 2016.[12] By February 3, 2016 oil was below $30—[13] a drop of \"almost 75 percent since mid-2014 as competing producers pumped 1–2 million barrels of crude daily exceeding demand, just as China's economy hit lowest growth in a generation.\"[14] Some analysts speculate that it may continue to drop further, perhaps as low as $18[15]"}
